One that was rejuvenated by the Kepler Mission. The objective of the Kepler Mission is to survey the structure and diversity of planetary systems, in hopes of discovering Earth-like planets. In doing so the Kepler telescope collects information on planetary systems such as planet size, radii, mass, size of the star, temperature of the star, all to determine whether it is a habitable planet. This project aims to perform a similar task. However, this team does not have nearly the funds to send a telescope into space like NASA does, so a different and low budget method was applied. This project uses two machine learning algorithm, logistic regression and MLP classifier to confirm whether an object of interest found by the Kepler telescope is indeed a planet. The target variable is the 'soltype' which gives the Kepler disposition, whether or no the object of interest was confirmed to be a planet or just a candidate.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"C5ypvlyR3wcu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#

candidate or confirmed planet. The random forest model was the better performing better model with an accuracy of 91% and the logistic regression having an accuracy of 78%. So with an accuracy of 91%, the Random forest can be applied to a new dataset, and be expected to perform well. The most important features underwere determined to be pl_eqt(Temperature), pl_radj(planet radius), pl_orbsmax(Orbit Semi-Major Axis), pl_orbincl(planet inclindation), pl_insol(Temperature), meaning that these variables were most impactul the the performance of the model. Also when evaluating the model, we determine the AUC of the best model, to have a value of 0.91. The closer the value is to 1 the better performing we can say our model to be. This value indicates how well our model can differentiate between classes."],"metadata":{"id":"ply3JIQoQY8z"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# References & Data Source"],"metadata":{"id":"hezPQXC4QUQq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html"],"metadata":{"id":"fpFnWOWKTFoL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Code was adopted from: \n","https://github.com/yuxiaohuang/teaching/blob/master/gwu/machine_learning_I/spring_2022/code/p2_shallow_learning/p2_c2_supervised_learning/p2_c2_s3_logistic_regression/case_study/case_study_bcw.ipynb"],"metadata":{"id":"xW--ZpVMSVfF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Data source:\n","https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS"],"metadata":{"id":"nitc7WhASxOb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Data set description: https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_PS_columns.html"],"metadata":{"id":"G4xCBp9WS6SV"}}]}
